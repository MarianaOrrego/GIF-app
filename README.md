## Tecnologies
- React.js
- CSS
- create-react-app template
- API Giphy

## The Process
One of the first applications developed using React. Knowledge was acquired on API consumption, component handling, creation of custom hooks, rendering of information (gifs in this case), and creation of styles to ensure a responsive page. Knowledge on best practices was reinforced.

## What I learned 
- API consumption
- Clean code
- Component handling
- Custom hooks creation

## Overall Growth
This project helped me understand API consumption, component handling, best practices, and project organization to make the code more programmer-friendly. On the other hand, creating custom hooks to develop tasks was a significant aspect of the project's development. In a professional context, the use of custom hooks is widely employed in React projects.

## How can it be improved?
- Improve the styles
- Add more functionalities like pagination, rendering more elements per search
